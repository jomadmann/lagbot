# Overall Bot Readme

#### For detailed examples and descriptions for most commands, read these docs.
These docs use the group names that are seen in the bot's help command, not the python module names.
#### For less helpful (but still useful) descriptions, use the bot's `!help` command.

##### Note you can also use `!help command` and `!help command subcommand` to see longer descriptions for most commands and subcommands.

###### Syntax in these docs:

* An argument wrapped with `<>` is required.
* An argument wrapped with `[]` is optional.
* The argument named `mention` means tagging/mentioning someone like `@OtherUser`

If you still have trouble understanding what a command does after reading the bot's `!help` commands and these docs, please do any of the following:

* Message sgtlaggy#5516 on Discord.
* Create an issue on this Github project.
* Edit the docstrings<sup>[1](#1)</sup> and make a pull request.

<p id="1">Note: The help command automatically pulls function docstrings for the help text.</p>
