# discordbot

This is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com) bot built using [discord.py by Danny/Rapptz](https://github.com/rapptz/discord.py).

Create a `config.json` file in the same folder as `bot.py` with the following contents:

```
{
    "source": "url to your repo/source code",
    "bot_token": "secret bot token"
}
```

* If your bot isn't open-source or you don't want anyone to easily find it, remove the "source" line.
