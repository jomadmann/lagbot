# discordbot

This is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com) bot built using [discord.py by Danny/Rapptz](https://github.com/rapptz/discord.py).

Create a file named `token.txt` that contains your OAUTH2 application "Client/Application ID" on the first line and your bot's token on the second line and run `bot.py` to run it.

If you don't include your Client/Application ID, you won't be able to use the `join` command.
